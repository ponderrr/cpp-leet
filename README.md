# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Challenge – Andrew & Nick

Welcome to our **LeetCode Daily Challenge** — a month-long journey to sharpen problem-solving skills, master different data structures, and build cross-language fluency.  
Andrew will solve each problem in **C++**, and Nick will solve the same problem in **Java**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
leetcode-challenge/
├── andrew-problems/ # C++ solutions
│ ├── day01_number_of_senior_citizens.cpp
│ ├── day02_running_sum.cpp
│ └── ...
├── nick-problems/ # Java solutions
│ ├── day01_NumberOfSeniorCitizens.java

├── README.md
└── roadmap.md # Detailed daily plan & topic progression
```

Each problem will be added daily under the respective folder.  
The file names follow the pattern:  
`dayXX_problem_name.ext` for consistency and clarity.

## 🧭 Study Philosophy

This challenge is built to:

- Build **daily problem-solving discipline**
- Strengthen **C++ and Java fundamentals**
- Develop a shared understanding of algorithmic design
- Progressively tackle harder problems across multiple data structures

We're starting easy, mastering fundamentals first, and incrementally moving toward medium-difficulty problems.

## 📅 30-Day Roadmap Overview

Each week introduces new concepts and problem patterns.  
You can find detailed problem listings in `roadmap.md`.

| Phase | Focus Area                    | Key Topics                              | Goal                                           |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Core Foundations**          | Arrays, Strings, Loops                  | Build comfort with syntax & logic              |
| 2     | **Patterns & Logic**          | Sliding Window, Prefix Sum, Hash Maps   | Recognize repeatable algorithmic structures    |
| 3     | **Data Structures Deep Dive** | Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Recursion | Learn standard containers & recursion thinking |
| 4     | **Search & Sorting Logic**    | Binary Search, Divide & Conquer         | Understand time complexity & recursion         |
| 5     | **Algorithmic Thinking**      | Graphs, BFS/DFS, Dynamic Programming    | Develop scalable reasoning skills              |

## 🚀 Daily Routine

**Every day:**

1. Pick the same LeetCode problem from `roadmap.md`.
2. Solve it individually (Andrew → C++, Nick → Java).
3. Push your code under your respective folder.
4. Discuss approaches, edge cases, and complexity together.

Each commit should follow this message pattern:

```
chore(day05): solved "Merge Sorted Array" in C++
```

---

## 🧩 Example (Day 1)

**Problem:** [2678. Number of Senior Citizens](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-senior-citizens/)  
**Concepts:** string parsing, indexing, conditionals  
**Key takeaway:** handling substrings and character arithmetic in C++ vs. Java.

## 💬 Collaboration Notes

- Weekly sync to review progress and reflect on what patterns you recognized.
- Focus on _clarity and reasoning_ over brute-force performance.
- End of month: mock interview with one Easy + one Medium problem.

---

## 🧱 Future Goals

- Introduce competitive programming rounds (e.g., biweekly timed sessions)
- Add automated testing for solutions (CMake / Gradle)
- Track complexity & performance improvements
