## üìù Notes

- Each day focuses on a specific concept with 1-2 practice problems
- Review days are built in to reinforce learning
- Problems are chosen to build complexity gradually
- Both Andrew (C++) and Nick (Java) will solve the same problems daily
- Track progress and discuss approaches after each problem
